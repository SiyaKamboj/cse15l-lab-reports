# Lab Report 5 - Report 4 Reflection

## What is Lab Report 4?
In Lab Report 4, we were tasked with learning how to navigate the command line quickly to make future programming tasks easier. Some of the tasks consisted of logging into the ieng6 server, cloning the testing repository, editing the failing tests, re-running the tests to ensure the edits are succesful, and, ultimately, commiting and pushing the change to my github account.
