# Lab Report 1

> Installing VSCode on my personal device

  Since VSCode was my IDE for CSE 11, I had already downloaded it on my macbook last quarter; hence, during lab, I skipped this step. However, to verify VSCode was still on my macbook, I searched for it in finder and took the screenshot above.
  

> Remotely Connecting to the computers in the CSE Building

  To remotely connect to the computers in the CSE Building, I tried to follow the [instructions]( https://ucsd-cse15l-w23.github.io/week/week1/#week-1-lab-report ) given in class. However, the rest of my lab group and I had issues setting our default terminals to use gitbash in VSCode. After about 5 minutes of difficulty, one of my group members (who also used a macbook) discovered that we could simply use the terminal on our macs instead of configuring the terminal in VSCode, since we are not using Windows. 
  
  After we solved the issue with the terminal, I was able to establish a connection with the lab computers by typing `ssh cs15lwi23atq@ieng6.ucsd.edu`. When I first connected, I had to confirm that I wanted to continue connecting by typing `yes`; however, after that, I received this message every time I connected, which did not prompt me to proceed with any further action, aside from typing in my password.
