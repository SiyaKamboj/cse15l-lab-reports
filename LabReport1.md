# Lab Report 1

> Installing VSCode on my personal device

![Image](images/vscode_downloaded.png)

  Since VSCode was my IDE for CSE 11, I had already downloaded it on my macbook last quarter; hence, during lab, I skipped this step. However, to verify VSCode was still on my macbook, I searched for it in finder and took the screenshot above.
  

> Remotely Connecting to the computers in the CSE Building

  To remotely connect to the computers in the CSE Building, I tried to follow the instructions given in class. However, the rest of my lab group and I had issues setting our default terminals to use gitbash in VSCode. After about 5 minutes of difficulty, one of my group members (who also used a macbook) discovered that we could simply use the terminal on our macs instead of configuring the terminal in VSCode.
